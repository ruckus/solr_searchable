SolrSearchable
==============

A Rails plugin to persist and search for ActiveRecord models in Apache Solr.


Dependences
===========

- WillPaginate gem for pagination
- RSolr : handles the actual communication with Solr

Example
=======

Declare your model like:

class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base

  solr_searchable :fields => [
    {:text => :first_name}, {:text => :last_name}, {:text => :bio},
    {:string => :favorite_color}, {:integer => :age},
    {:boolean => :likes_peanuts}
  ]
  
end

Index your models: 

Profile.rebuild_solr_index

Searching:

clause = SolrSearchable::Clause.new(Profile)
clause.and(:first_name => 'Cody', :last_name => 'Caughlan')
clause.or(:age => 30)

If you feel comfortable building your own query string by hand you can do that too - the query building Clause stuff is just
to make it easy to build queries

#=> Effectively generates the query: (first name is 'Cody AND last_name is Caughlan) OR (age is 30)

results = Profile.paginate_by_solr(clause.to_s, :page => 1, :per_page => 10)

or 

results = Profile.find_by_solr(clause.to_s)
